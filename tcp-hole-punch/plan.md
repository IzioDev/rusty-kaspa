# TCP Hole Punch Integration Plan

## Progress Snapshot
- ✅ **Phase 1 – Baseline hole punching**  
  - Successful direct punch: see `TEST_SCENARIOS.md` (VPS dialer scenario) and raw logs in `logs/dialer_vps_scenario.log`.  
  - Negative case (expected relay fallback): documented in `logs/hotspot-scenario-summary.md`.
- ✅ **Phase 2 – Build the libp2p ⇄ tonic bridge**
- 🔄 **Phase 3 – Extend the Kaspa adaptor/router**.
- ⏳ **Phase 4 – Two-private-peer PoC**.

## Phase 1 – Reproduce Baseline Hole Punching
- ✅ Relay, listener, and dialer binaries exercised.  
  - Positive case (VPS dialer ↔ home listener) produced a direct TCP channel – evidence in `logs/dialer_vps_scenario.log` and summary in `TEST_SCENARIOS.md`.  
  - Negative case (hotspot dialer) remained on the relay, captured in `logs/hotspot-scenario-summary.md` for reference.
- Timing, multiaddrs, and Swarm events recorded to guide Phase 2 expectations (`logs/phase1-summary.md`).

## Phase 2 – Build the libp2p ⇄ tonic Bridge
- [x] Document bridge usage and swarm lifecycle in `design/phase2-architecture.md`.
- [x] Implement swarm actor, dual-stack stream wrapper, and tonic integration helper APIs under `bridge/src/`.
- [x] Provide deterministic tests: `libp2p_dial_yields_stream`, `tonic_server_accepts_libp2p_stream`, and URI error coverage.
- [x] Ensure the test suite (`cargo test --manifest-path tcp-hole-punch/bridge/Cargo.toml`) runs cleanly in <50 ms.
- [x] Prepare Phase 3 handoff notes (adaptor integration, metrics, relay/DCUtR re-enable plan).

## Phase 3 – Extend the Kaspa Adaptor/Router
- [x] Add an adaptor entrypoint that accepts an owned `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Send + 'static` stream (in addition to the existing URI dial path) and plumb it through `ConnectionHandler::connect`/`Router::new`.
- [x] Thread `Libp2pConnectInfo` (peer id, multiaddr, relay flag) into the router so logging/metrics can surface libp2p context.
- [x] Decide when to re-enable relay/DCUtR/QUIC behaviours and expose the necessary knobs (connection limits, retry cadence).
- [x] Update adaptor/unit tests to cover the new stream-based handshake path (see `kaspa_p2p_lib::core::connection_handler::tests::connect_with_stream_establishes_router`).

## Phase 4 – Deliver the Two-Private-Peer PoC
- Modify `protocol/p2p/src/bin/{server.rs,client.rs}` to source their transport from the libp2p bridge while keeping the Kaspa handshake and flow registration intact.
- Script the three-node test (public relay + two NATed Kaspa binaries) to demonstrate sustained Kaspa gossip over a hole-punched TCP connection, recording fallback behaviour (relay persistence, QUIC attempts, retry cadence).
- Document operational knobs and open policy items: relay inventory, connection/relay limits, PeerId↔PeerKey unification, and peer-store schema updates for storing Multiaddrs/observed addresses.

## Phase 3 – Status (handover)
- [x] Adopt `Libp2pStream` in the Kaspa adaptor/router
- [x] Thread bridge metadata into logging/metrics
- [x] Re-enable relay/DCUtR behaviours once adaptor path exists
- [x] Extend adaptor tests to cover libp2p streams (run `cargo test -p kaspa-p2p-lib connect_with_stream_establishes_router -- --nocapture`)
- Latest verification (2025-10-28): `cargo check -p kaspa-p2p-lib`, `cargo check -p kaspa-p2p-lib --no-default-features --features libp2p-bridge`, `cargo test -p kaspa-p2p-lib connect_with_stream_establishes_router -- --nocapture`, and `cargo test --manifest-path tcp-hole-punch/bridge/Cargo.toml` all pass; libp2p-enabled demo usage is captured in `design/phase2-architecture.md`.
